# Name Parsing Accuracy Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Trust Name Extraction Pattern (FIXED)
**Problem:** Trust names were being parsed incorrectly. "Cole Beulah Revocable Trust" was extracting as first="Cole", last="Beulah" (wrong order).

**Root Cause:** Contradictory examples in Gemini prompt at line 153 teaching wrong pattern.

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed Pattern T1 description (lines 149-155) to correctly explain agricultural data follows LastName FirstName order
- Updated example from "Beulah Cole precedes 'Revocable'" to proper explanation
- Result: "Cole Beulah Revocable Trust" now correctly extracts as first="Beulah", last="Cole"

### 2. Trust Entity Gender Assignment (FIXED)
**Problem:** Trust entities were getting gender="female" or "male" instead of "unknown"

**Root Cause:** 
- Prompt example at line 322 showed trust with gender="female" 
- No enforcement of entity gender rules

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added CRITICAL ENTITY RULE in prompt (lines 271-273) stating non-person entities MUST have gender="unknown"
- Fixed example at line 321-323 to show gender="unknown" for trusts
- Added post-processing enforcement (lines 760-764) to override any gender for trust/company entities
- Result: All trusts and companies now have gender="unknown" and gender_confidence=0.0

### 3. JSON Parsing Errors (FIXED)
**Problem:** 40% of responses had "Extra data: line 1 column 2" JSON parsing errors

**Root Causes:**
- Insufficient token limits causing truncated responses
- Gemini adding extra text before JSON array
- Weak instructions about JSON-only output

**Fixes Applied:**
- Increased maxOutputTokens from max(200, len(names) * 80) to max(500, len(names) * 150) (line 621)
- Strengthened JSON instructions with "CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON array" (lines 285-287)
- Improved JSON extraction to remove text before first '[' (lines 676-685)
- Enhanced bracket balancing that considers string boundaries (lines 687-722)

### 4. Family Trust Handling (FIXED)
**Problem:** Family trusts were extracting incorrect names

**Fix Applied:**
- Fallback parser correctly identifies "Family Trust" pattern and only extracts last name
- "Cheslak Family Trust" now correctly extracts as first="", last="Cheslak"

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Trust name accuracy: ~60%
- JSON parsing success: ~60%
- Trust gender assignment: Incorrect (showing male/female)
