- **Maintainability**: Reusable scripts, centralized validation, comprehensive docs

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed - CRITICAL
- **Client IP Detection**: Fixed critical bug where backend used nginx container IP (172.x.x.x) instead of real client IP
  - All anonymous users were sharing the same IP quota (first user exhausted 5 parses, blocking everyone else)
  - Security breach: users could potentially access each other's jobs via IP matching
  - Created centralized `get_client_ip()` utility that reads X-Forwarded-For headers from nginx reverse proxy
  - Updated 9 backend files to use the new utility (files/router.py, dependencies.py, all middleware, auth routers)
  - Added extensive IP detection logging for production debugging

### Fixed - Anonymous Processing
- **ProcessingStatus Race Condition**: Fixed Refresh button calling wrong fetch function for anonymous users
  - Now correctly calls `fetchSingleJob()` for anonymous users vs `fetchJobs()` for authenticated
  - Prevents 403 errors and improves stability for anonymous processing flow

### Added - Anonymous User UX
- **Column Selector Hidden**: Anonymous users no longer see custom column name selector
  - Enforces default column detection ('name' or 'parse_string') for simplicity
  - Reduces confusion for trial users
- **Download Tier Notice**: Added clear notice for anonymous users explaining parsed-only downloads
  - Shows 8 essential fields included (entity type, name components, company, trust, confidence)
  - Links to registration for full data access
- **Download Button Clarity**: Button text now reads "Download Parsed Results" for anonymous users vs "Download Results" for authenticated

### Technical Improvements
- **IP Utility**: New `/backend/app/utils/client_ip.py` provides centralized IP extraction with proper fallbacks
  - Priority order: X-Forwarded-For → X-Real-IP → direct connection (dev fallback)
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging production IP detection
- **Code Deduplication**: Removed duplicate `_get_client_ip()` methods from middleware files
- **Anonymous Flow Hardening**: Better error handling and navigation guards for anonymous processing

### Impact
- **Anonymous Processing Restored**: Each anonymous user now gets their own 5-parse quota
- **Security Hardened**: Users can no longer access each other's jobs via shared IP
- **Better UX**: Clear communication about free tier limitations and upgrade path

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-16
